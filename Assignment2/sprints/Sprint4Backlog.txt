November 12th to November 18th 

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user I should be able to list all files and folders within folders,
   including sub-folders
b) As a user I should be able to save the output of any command into a file.
   I should be able to overwrite a file with this output and be able to add the output to the end of a file.
c) As a user, I shouldn't be able to redirect the output of exit to a file and
   I expect to get an error when I try to do so.
d) As a user when I try to see the contents of multiple files, if I provided
   a wrong path I still expect to be shown all valid files on the other correct paths
e) As a user, I should be able to move any files or folders to a new location.
f) As a user, I should be able to download files from the internet and save it.
