What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Echo with >> works with existing files
    - Echo with > works with existing files
    - Echo is able to parse arguments
    - Restructured the program a little bit

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Review the design, do more testing with the code.
    - Make echo be able to create new files if none exists.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not really for this time :)
