What did I work on in the last three days?
	- fixed bug in parser class
	- created MkDir class
	- MkDir can now create directories in any absolute or relative path
	- MkDir can validate if path is correct and throws errors if a directory exists
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- the ls command from the current directory
	- the ls command from any directory

Am I blocked on anything?
