What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Continued to debug parser class, many little bugs on edge cases were found

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- write the ls command
	- the ls command should be able to call from any directory as well as current
	- create and write crc cards for directory, parser, ls classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not blocked on anything at the moment
