What did I work on in the last three days?
	- debugged mkdir command, a folder should correctly be created given any correct path
	- further mkdir debugging, mkdir doesn't allow mkdir / anymore
	- debugged ls command, doing ls / correctly prints "/:"

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- javadoc for function
	- clean up some function codes
	- create crc cards for missing functions

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not blocked on anything at the moment
