What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Coded the Environment class, make sure it is passed to all commands
    - Made sure environment contains a stack for command history
    - Made shell passively push commands onto stack
    - Shell now initializes a root directory (/)

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Code the file class that represents a text file
    - Create AppendFileOutputIO and OverwriteFileOutputIO class
    - Make sure Echo can parse the arguments to make sure they are valid

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need OutputIO parent class
