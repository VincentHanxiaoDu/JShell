    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-
